    <h2> BIG DREAM </h2> 
    <h4> I will become a seasoned astronomer and professional programmer and web developer. </h4> 
    <p> I have already learned the basics of web development thanks to progHero. I will not stop until I become a pro web developer. All I need now is some more advanced knowledge on the subject and I am ready for commands. Concerning astronomy I don't yet have the opportunity to study it extensively but with the few books I have come across, I hope to get all the knowledge I can. All to the glory of God.</p>
